# AlCoMa - Altered Collection Manager

## What is this?

A simple tool to get an overview over your digital Altered TCG collection.

You can also export some data, like cards you're missing or you have a surplus of.

## Should I use this?

No

## Why?

In order to get your collection from the Altered API, the tool needs an Access Token. Currently, the only way to get an Access Token is to use your browser's dev tools; and the token you'll find in there will give anyone full access to your collection.

You should not give anyone your Access Token, especially random applications you download from the internet.

So use this tool at your own risk!
